			<p>Our website is a work of fiction, nothing on this website is factual by any means.
			<br>
			<br>
Why make the website?: This website acts as a hosting platform for the original artwork we have on display on our Products page, the inspiration behind the 9 Lives brand was a retailer that sells otherworldly products that take inspiration from Junji Ito, H.P Lovecraft, Dungeons & Dragons & various mythological creatures & beliefs such as Japanese Yokai.

<br>
<br>
Can I buy the art?: The art isn’t for sale, this site works more as a gallery for the artwork. But the artwork can be used as long as credit is given.

<br>
<br>
What was the idea behind the website?: The idea behind the website was a Warlock named Aki going between dimensions & selling the things he found, some being safe to use, the others being indirectly harmful to the user or outright dangerous. This idea was the basis of our work in our Art Design 301 course & the idea of making a website was one of the first ideas to come with it, therefore the site was in its development.

<br>
<br>
Will the site continue to run?: The site was made as a short term project, so keeping the site running wasn’t a major concern considering we didn’t expect to make such a massive leap in quality with the art we were (& still are) creating, though we plan to continue making the type of art hosted on the site, we plan to keep records of it on other websites & services such as Instagram, Twitter & Discord.
